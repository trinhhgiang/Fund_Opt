# Harvest Problem

This repository contains solutions to the Harvest Problem, which involves optimizing the harvesting schedule for a set of agricultural fields to comply with both minimum and maximum processing capacity constraints at a processing plant, while minimizing the difference in the number of agricultural products harvested between days.

## Files

- `data.txt`: A sample data folder with different sizes for the problem.

- `harvest_backtracking.py`: A solution to the Harvest Problem using backtracking.

- `harvest_SimulatedAnnealing.py`: A solution to the Harvest Problem using simulated annealing.

- `harvest_genetic.py`: A solution to the Harvest Problem using genetic algorithm.

- `read_data.py`:  Reads the data text file and returns N, m, M, d, s, e and n.

## Usage

In order to use the `read_data.py` to read the data file correctly, please make sure to adjust the file path according to your environment.
